## Steps

The script run_analysis.R performs 5 steps to get the desired output file.

1. merge dataset, making files having the same number of columns and referring to the same entities.
2. only those columns with the mean and standard deviation measures are taken from the whole dataset. After extracting these columns, they are given the correct names, taken from features.txt.
3. take the activity names and IDs from activity_labels.txt.
4. correct column names in the whole dataset.
5. generate a new dataset with all the average measures for each subject and activity type.

## Variables
"subject" "activity" "tBodyAcc-mean()-X" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "tBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "tBodyAcc-std()-X" "tBodyAcc-std()-Y" "tBodyAcc-std()-Z" "tGravityAcc-mean()-X" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Y" "tGravityAcc-mean()-Z" "tGravityAcc-std()-X" "tGravityAcc-std()-Y" "tGravityAcc-std()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyGyro-mean()-X" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyro-std()-X" "tBodyGyro-std()-Y" "tBodyGyro-std()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-mean()-Z" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-X" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Y" "tBodyGyroJerk-std()-Z" "tBodyAccMag-mean()" "tBodyAccMag-std()" "tGravityAccMag-mean()" "tGravityAccMag-std()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "tBodyGyroMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroMag-std()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "tBodyGyroJerkMag-std()" "fBodyAcc-mean()-X" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Y" "fBodyAcc-mean()-Z" "fBodyAcc-std()-X" "fBodyAcc-std()-Y" "fBodyAcc-std()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-mean()-Z" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-X" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Y" "fBodyAccJerk-std()-Z" "fBodyGyro-mean()-X" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Y" "fBodyGyro-mean()-Z" "fBodyGyro-std()-X" "fBodyGyro-std()-Y" "fBodyGyro-std()-Z" "fBodyAccMag-mean()" "fBodyAccMag-std()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyAccJerkMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroMag-std()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-mean()" "fBodyBodyGyroJerkMag-std()"
